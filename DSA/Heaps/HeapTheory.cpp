    Heaps:- A heap is a complete binary tree that follows the heap order property.
        - Complete Binary Tree:- All levels are completely filled except the last level, the last level
                                 is filled from left to right.

        - Heap Order Property:- 1. Max Heap -> Every parent node is greater than or equal to its 
                                               childern, the largest element is always at root.
                                2. Min Heap -> Every parent node is smaller that or equal to its
                                               children the smallest element is always at top.

    *Heap is not a Binary Search Tree(BST).

    -> For 1-based 'i' index of heap:- 1. Left child = 2*i; where i is index of that element.
                                       2. Right child = 2*i + 1  
                                       3. Parent = i/2
            
    -> For 0-based 'i' index of heap:- 1. Left child = 2*i + 1
                                       2. Right child = 2*i + 2
                                       3. Parent = (i-1)/2
