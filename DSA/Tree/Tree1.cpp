    1. Leaf -> A node with no children.
    2. Internal Node -> A node which is not a leaf.
    3. Sibling Nodes -> The children of same parent. 
    4. Length of Path -> Length of path is 1 less than the number of nodes on the path.
    5. Ancestor & Descendents -> If there is path from node A to node B, then A is called an ancestor
                                 of B and B is called a descendents of A.
    6. Subtree -> Any node of a tree, with all of its descendents is a subtree.
    7. Level -> The level of the node referes to its distance from the root, the root of the tree has
                generally level 0.
